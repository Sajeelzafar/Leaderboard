# Leaderboard API

> In this project, a leaderboard is established using webpack and javascript. A new game can be started refreshing all the previous leaderboard data. The data is stored on a server using APIs and can also be accessed using the key. The latest key is stored in the local storage so that the data is not lost when refreshed. By default, the first game data will load initially.
